Space Complexity of Selection Sort
The space complexity of Selection Sort is O(1).

This is because we use only constant extra space such as:

2 variables to enable swapping of elements.
One variable to keep track of smallest element in unsorted array.
Hence, in terms of Space Complexity, Selection Sort is optimal as the memory requirements remain same for every input.
